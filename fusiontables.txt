Just some initial input, ideas, and learned concepts about google fusion tables (gft)

Service requires authentication

RESTful service. Start with get:
  
Requests for data must be had with OAuth2.0, and must have been registered with google

API Key= AIzaSyBjFERCVuTDF8IGjaGx1XhYQ7HfzUxvpRs
API name = losses-of-life

All calls to the sql server are simply tagged to the end of the url. Template looks like this:
https://www.googleapis.com/fusiontables/v1/query?sql=SELECT ROWID FROM {tableId&key}={your_API_key}

Series of steps required before gft will allow changes to be made
see oauth2.0
