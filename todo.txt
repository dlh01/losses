# Shit to do for losses:

* Familiarize myself with google fusion tables(gft)
* Code specific to losses to snag info from gft, place graphs on page

* Homepage design
* Discuss other features

Dave:
  Need to think about data and backing store
  All other stuff is secondary i.e. display
  how are we putting data onto table?

Me:
  location (+ lat/lon), geocoding
  search by country, time, region
  week based system is scrapped. 
  Stats?
  Old data 

Dave:
  ap on browser, pops up with fields to fill in regarding the data for fusion tables


Plans:
  1. Google fusion tables interaction
  2. Delivery widget

	Scrap OAuth2
	possibly scrap the whole UI for data entry

	what takes the most time: finding articles
	"pathe the cow path" - make a sidewalk only after we know where we tread

	data entry traditional workflow: 
		find articles
		scour for data
		varify data
		post
	
	homework:
		find articles to scour over
	goal: 
		build regular expressions to do the scouring based on patterns we find
