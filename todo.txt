# Shit to do for losses:

* Familiarize myself with google fusion tables(gft)
* Desktop widget to add new events to gft
* Code specific to losses to snag info from gft, place graphs on page

* Homepage design
* Discuss other features

Dave:
  Need to think about data and backing store
  All other stuff is secondary i.e. display
  how are we putting data onto table?

Me:
  location (+ lat/lon), geocoding
  search by country, time, region
  week based system is scrapped. 
  Stats?
  Old data 

Dave:
  ap on browser, pops up with fields to fill in regarding the data for fusion tables


Plans:
  1. Google fusion tables interaction
  2. Delivery widget
