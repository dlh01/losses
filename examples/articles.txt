Police in Wisconsin searched Sunday for a man suspected of killing three people and wounding four others in a shooting at a spa in suburban Milwaukee.

Police identified the suspect as Radcliffe Franklin Haughton, 45, of Brown Deer. Brookfield Police Chief Dan Tushaus said Haughton's car had been found, but he was still at large.

The Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reported that Haughton grew up in Wheeling and Northbrook.

The shooting happened about 11 a.m. at the Azana Day Spa, a two-story, 9,000-square-foot building across from a major shopping mall in a middle- to upper-class community west of Milwaukee.

An improvised explosive device was found at the spa, and a bomb squad was investigating, Tushaus said. Spokesmen for the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said their agencies also had agents participating in the investigation.

The mall, a country club adjacent to the spa, a nearby hospital and other buildings were locked down as police searched for Haughton, local media reported.

Tushaus described the situation as "fluid and ongoing," saying officers were initially focused on reaching and helping the victims.

Gina Kralik, a bartender at Red Robin Gourmet Burgers in the mall, said by telephone that the restaurant was still locked down as of about 3 p.m. She said 18 people were there - all employees except for a couple reporters who managed to get in. She said people were allowed to leave at one point, but then the police decided not to let anyone come or go from the mall.

"We're just sitting watching the news and also trying to find out what's going on," she said.

Online court records showed a temporary restraining order was issued against Haughton in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on Oct. 8 because of a domestic abuse complaint.

Haughton appeared in court Thursday, when a no-contact order was issued and he was told to turn all his weapons over to the sheriff's department.

Beth Strohbusch, a spokeswoman for Froedtert Memorial Hospital — the hospital that was locked down — said four shooting victims were taken there, none in critical condition.

It was the second mass shooting in Wisconsin this year. Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran and white supremacist, killed six people and injured three others before fatally shooting himself Aug. 5 at a Sikh temple south of Milwaukee.

The shooting at the mall took place less than a mile from where seven people were killed and four wounded on March 12, 2005, when a gunman opened fire at a Living Church of God service held at a hotel.

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — A taxi packed with explosives blew up near a police station in the Syrian capital Sunday, killing 13 people as the U.N. envoy tasked with ending the country’s civil war pushed his call for a cease-fire in talks with President Bashar Assad.

The blast, which also wounded 29 people in the popular shopping district of Bab Touma, was overshadowed however by anti-Syria violence in neighboring Lebanon.

Hundreds of angry Lebanese protesters tried to storm the government headquarters in the capital, Beirut, blaming Syria for the Friday assassination of a top Lebanese intelligence official and accusing the government of being far too close to the Assad regime. For much of the past 30 years, Lebanon has lived under Syrian military and political domination.

In Syria, two government officials speaking from the scene of the blast said the taxi exploded 50 meters (yards) from the main police station in Bab Touma, a neighborhood in Damascus’ Old City. They insisted on anonymity because they were not allowed to brief the media.

An Associated Press reporter at the site said blood stained the street and sidewalks, shards of glass littered the pavement from shattered shop windows, and the charred hulks of at least four cars littered the street.

Vegetable vendor Mohammad Hanbali, 27, said several people wounded in the blast were lying on the street when he rushed to help.

‘‘It’s a cowardly act, carried out by terrorists,’’ said Hanbali, who was hit by a piece of shrapnel in the left leg.

State news agency SANA put the death toll at 13, while the anti-regime Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 10 people were killed.

Bab Touma is mainly inhabited by Syria’s Christian minority.

Damascus has been a frequent target of bombings in recent months, although it was once largely immune to the violence spreading across the country since the anti-Assad revolt began in March 2011.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday’s blast, but Islamist groups fighting alongside the rebels have in the past said they target security installations in the capital.

In another part of the city, U.N. and Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met with Assad to push for a cease-fire between rebels and government forces for the four-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which begins Oct. 26.

Brahimi said that he met earlier with Syrian opposition groups inside and outside the country to discuss his truce plan. He said he received ‘‘promises’’ but ‘‘not a commitment’’ from them to honor the cease-fire.

He told reporters that he ‘‘found an overwhelming response’’ from Assad’s opponents to his cease-fire plan and that ‘‘all of them have said that it’s a good idea which they support.’’

He declined to reveal Assad’s response to his plan, viewed as a preliminary step toward a larger deal.

SANA reported that Assad assured Brahimi he supported his effort, but it did not say whether he committed to a truce.

‘‘The president said he is open to any sincere effort to find a political solution to the crisis on the basis of respecting Syrian sovereignty and rejecting foreign interference,’’ it said.

It added that Assad also stressed a political solution must be ‘‘based on the principle of halting terrorism, a commitment from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harboring terrorists in Syria to stop doing such acts.’’

 Syrian authorities blame the anti-government uprising on a foreign conspiracy and accuse Saudi Arabia and Qatar, along with the U.S, other Western countries and Turkey, of funding, training and arming the rebels, whom they describe as ‘‘terrorists.’’

For months, Turkey served as headquarters for the leaders of the ragtag Free Syrian Army before the rebel group shifted its command to Syria. It also hosts many meetings of the Syrian National Council opposition group. Relations between the two countries, once close, have been deteriorating since the crisis began last year and Ankara became one of Assad’s harshest critics.

Brahimi said he was ‘‘hopeful that the holiday in Syria will be calm if not happy.’’ He said that he will return to the country afterward. ‘‘If we find that this calm is actually achieved during the holiday and continued, we will try to build on it,’’ he added.

Brahimi arrived in Damascus Friday after a tour of Middle East capitals to drum up support for the cease-fire. A range of countries including Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Germany have backed the idea.

Syrian government forces and rebels have both agreed in the past to internationally brokered cease-fires, only to then promptly violate them, and there is little indication that either side is willing to stop fighting now.

***** 3 dead; OCT 21, 2012; Maareb, Yemen
* # men ... were killed (# spelled out)

SANAA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Three thought to be al Qaeda militants were killed in an apparent U.S. drone attack on a car in Yemen on Sunday, tribal sources and local officials said.

The men's car was driving through the south-eastern province of Maareb, a mostly desert region where militants have taken refuge after being driven from southern strongholds.

Yemen, where al Qaeda militants exploited a security vacuum during last year's uprising that ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh, has seen an intensified campaign of U.S. missile strikes in recent months, often using the pilotless aircraft known as drones.

Yemen's wealthier Gulf neighbours and Washington are concerned that al Qaeda and other Islamist fighters operating in Yemen could pose a threat to Saudi Arabia and to nearby shipping channels.

Interim president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, praised by the U.S. ambassador in Sanaa as being more effective against al Qaeda than his predecessor, was quoted as saying during a U.S. trip last month that he personally approved every attack.

While Washington usually avoids comment on the strikes in Yemen, the UK-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks U.S. operations, says as many as 56 civilians have been killed this year by drones.

***** 30 dead; OCT 20, 2012; Bani Walid, Libya
*killed at least # people

WADI DINAR, Libya (AP) — Pro-government militias battled fighters in a former stronghold of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, the fifth straight day of clashes that have killed at least 30 people.

The fighting in Bani Walid, some 140 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, has overlapped with the anniversary of Gadhafi's capture and killing on Oct. 20, 2011. A year since his death brought an end to Libya's civil war, Bani Walid is the most significant city in the country to still resist the nation's new authorities.

A resident said Sunday by telephone that pro-government militias and fighters in the city were clashing on its outskirts. The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said there were reports of new casualties, but that the fighting was less intense than a day earlier.

In Tripoli, some two hundred protesters demonstrated in front of the parliament building to urge the end of the fighting, which they say is harming only civilians. The demonstration was dispersed by a massive show of force when army units pulled up and opened fire above the heads of the crowd with heavy weaponry.

Government forces near Bani Walid said there were no civilians in the conflict area, and they had helped evacuate hundreds of residents a day earlier.

The official LANA news agency said at least 22 pro-government militiamen were killed during clashes Saturday. Pro-government militiamen said most of the casualties came during an ambush by fighters in the besieged city.

The violence Saturday coincided with conflicting reports about whether security forces had arrested Gadhafi's former spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, in Bani Walid.

The government said its forces had apprehended Ibrahim, but never produced evidence to support its statement. Then an audio recording purportedly by Ibrahim surfaced on the Internet denying that he had been arrested or that he was even in Libya.

The reports of Ibrahim's alleged arrested sparked brief celebrations in the Libyan capital. But in a reflection of the persistent lack of confidence in the new authorities, Libyans quickly began to demand that the government produce evidence — photographs or video — to back up their claims.

Government spokesmen could not be reached for further comment about Ibrahim.

Violence has flared periodically over the last year in Bani Walid. This round of fighting began when the pro-government Libya Shield militia besieged the town, blaming residents for the death of a well-known anti-Gadhafi rebel. Negotiations to hand over the suspects in the killing had failed.

Pro-government fighters on the road outside of Bani Walid were transporting fleeing civilians and foreign workers from the fighting. Some of the fleeing workers said others were locked up in the city because of the heavy shelling.

In the Wadi Dinar area, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside of Bani Walid, one pro-government fighter said civilians in the city are making it harder for his troops to go after fighters loyal to Gadhafi.

"We are doing two jobs. We are rescuing foreign workers, Egyptians and Africans, and putting them on vehicles out of the fighting area, and we are combing the area for armed gunmen," he said speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

Another fighter, Nidal, from Libya Shield, said the fighting over Bani Walid was focused on two fronts but that his opponents are well armed. He was speaking as clashes continued at the Wadi Dinar gate into the city, saying his force and the Bani Walid fighters were exchanging fire from two hilltops.

"This is going to take more than one day. There is a distance between us," he said.

In Tripoli, the situation in the late afternoon was tense around the parliament with dozens of protesters at the doors of the building itself while outside a few hundred more called for the end to the siege.

Militiamen acting as police arrived to contain the crowd but many were from the Souq al-Jumaa neighborhood, which earlier in the year lost several fighters in Bani Walid. The confrontation resulted in angry exchanges.

The men fired in the air several times to disperse the crowd, who responded with defiance, waving Libyan revolutionary flags and bearing their chests in front of the militiamen. Women made up around half of the crowd.

"In Bani Walid no one supports Gadhafi," said a veiled woman who identified herself only as Um Mohammed, or mother of Mohammed. "We support this government."

Um Mohammed said her children and husband were in Bani Walid.

"We need protection," she said, expressing her fears that the pro-government militias would take their revenge on the city and destroy it like they have others.

The militiamen were unsympathetic and at times prevented the protesters from talking to journalists and started hauling people out of the crowd, detaining them and beating them near their trucks.

"These people here say they want their freedom, but we gave them a lot of chances to change their mind," said one militiaman. "A lot of Gadhafi people are hiding there and people from Bani Walid have killed a lot of people form Souq al-Jumaa."

The standoff ended when 12 army trucks pulled up filled with men wearing new camouflage uniforms who fired into the air with anti-aircraft guns, sending everyone to the ground.

The trucks then drove into the parliament compound and used similar methods to disperse the people inside. Journalists were also stopped from photographing.
