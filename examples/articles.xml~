			Police in Wisconsin searched Sunday for a man suspected of killing three people and wounding four others in a shooting at a spa in suburban Milwaukee.

Police identified the suspect as Radcliffe Franklin Haughton, 45, of Brown Deer. Brookfield Police Chief Dan Tushaus said Haughton's car had been found, but he was still at large.

The Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reported that Haughton grew up in Wheeling and Northbrook.

The shooting happened about 11 a.m. at the Azana Day Spa, a two-story, 9,000-square-foot building across from a major shopping mall in a middle- to upper-class community west of Milwaukee.

An improvised explosive device was found at the spa, and a bomb squad was investigating, Tushaus said. Spokesmen for the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said their agencies also had agents participating in the investigation.

The mall, a country club adjacent to the spa, a nearby hospital and other buildings were locked down as police searched for Haughton, local media reported.

Tushaus described the situation as "fluid and ongoing," saying officers were initially focused on reaching and helping the victims.

Gina Kralik, a bartender at Red Robin Gourmet Burgers in the mall, said by telephone that the restaurant was still locked down as of about 3 p.m. She said 18 people were there - all employees except for a couple reporters who managed to get in. She said people were allowed to leave at one point, but then the police decided not to let anyone come or go from the mall.

"We're just sitting watching the news and also trying to find out what's going on," she said.

Online court records showed a temporary restraining order was issued against Haughton in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on Oct. 8 because of a domestic abuse complaint.

Haughton appeared in court Thursday, when a no-contact order was issued and he was told to turn all his weapons over to the sheriff's department.

Beth Strohbusch, a spokeswoman for Froedtert Memorial Hospital — the hospital that was locked down — said four shooting victims were taken there, none in critical condition.

It was the second mass shooting in Wisconsin this year. Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran and white supremacist, killed six people and injured three others before fatally shooting himself Aug. 5 at a Sikh temple south of Milwaukee.

The shooting at the mall took place less than a mile from where seven people were killed and four wounded on March 12, 2005, when a gunman opened fire at a Living Church of God service held at a hotel.

			AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — A taxi packed with explosives blew up near a police station in the Syrian capital Sunday, killing 13 people as the U.N. envoy tasked with ending the country’s civil war pushed his call for a cease-fire in talks with President Bashar Assad.

The blast, which also wounded 29 people in the popular shopping district of Bab Touma, was overshadowed however by anti-Syria violence in neighboring Lebanon.

Hundreds of angry Lebanese protesters tried to storm the government headquarters in the capital, Beirut, blaming Syria for the Friday assassination of a top Lebanese intelligence official and accusing the government of being far too close to the Assad regime. For much of the past 30 years, Lebanon has lived under Syrian military and political domination.

In Syria, two government officials speaking from the scene of the blast said the taxi exploded 50 meters (yards) from the main police station in Bab Touma, a neighborhood in Damascus’ Old City. They insisted on anonymity because they were not allowed to brief the media.

An Associated Press reporter at the site said blood stained the street and sidewalks, shards of glass littered the pavement from shattered shop windows, and the charred hulks of at least four cars littered the street.

Vegetable vendor Mohammad Hanbali, 27, said several people wounded in the blast were lying on the street when he rushed to help.

‘‘It’s a cowardly act, carried out by terrorists,’’ said Hanbali, who was hit by a piece of shrapnel in the left leg.

State news agency SANA put the death toll at 13, while the anti-regime Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 10 people were killed.

Bab Touma is mainly inhabited by Syria’s Christian minority.

Damascus has been a frequent target of bombings in recent months, although it was once largely immune to the violence spreading across the country since the anti-Assad revolt began in March 2011.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday’s blast, but Islamist groups fighting alongside the rebels have in the past said they target security installations in the capital.

In another part of the city, U.N. and Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met with Assad to push for a cease-fire between rebels and government forces for the four-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which begins Oct. 26.

Brahimi said that he met earlier with Syrian opposition groups inside and outside the country to discuss his truce plan. He said he received ‘‘promises’’ but ‘‘not a commitment’’ from them to honor the cease-fire.

He told reporters that he ‘‘found an overwhelming response’’ from Assad’s opponents to his cease-fire plan and that ‘‘all of them have said that it’s a good idea which they support.’’

He declined to reveal Assad’s response to his plan, viewed as a preliminary step toward a larger deal.

SANA reported that Assad assured Brahimi he supported his effort, but it did not say whether he committed to a truce.

‘‘The president said he is open to any sincere effort to find a political solution to the crisis on the basis of respecting Syrian sovereignty and rejecting foreign interference,’’ it said.

It added that Assad also stressed a political solution must be ‘‘based on the principle of halting terrorism, a commitment from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harboring terrorists in Syria to stop doing such acts.’’

 Syrian authorities blame the anti-government uprising on a foreign conspiracy and accuse Saudi Arabia and Qatar, along with the U.S, other Western countries and Turkey, of funding, training and arming the rebels, whom they describe as ‘‘terrorists.’’

For months, Turkey served as headquarters for the leaders of the ragtag Free Syrian Army before the rebel group shifted its command to Syria. It also hosts many meetings of the Syrian National Council opposition group. Relations between the two countries, once close, have been deteriorating since the crisis began last year and Ankara became one of Assad’s harshest critics.

Brahimi said he was ‘‘hopeful that the holiday in Syria will be calm if not happy.’’ He said that he will return to the country afterward. ‘‘If we find that this calm is actually achieved during the holiday and continued, we will try to build on it,’’ he added.

Brahimi arrived in Damascus Friday after a tour of Middle East capitals to drum up support for the cease-fire. A range of countries including Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Germany have backed the idea.

Syrian government forces and rebels have both agreed in the past to internationally brokered cease-fires, only to then promptly violate them, and there is little indication that either side is willing to stop fighting now.

			SANAA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Three thought to be al Qaeda militants were killed in an apparent U.S. drone attack on a car in Yemen on Sunday, tribal sources and local officials said.

The men's car was driving through the south-eastern province of Maareb, a mostly desert region where militants have taken refuge after being driven from southern strongholds.

Yemen, where al Qaeda militants exploited a security vacuum during last year's uprising that ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh, has seen an intensified campaign of U.S. missile strikes in recent months, often using the pilotless aircraft known as drones.

Yemen's wealthier Gulf neighbours and Washington are concerned that al Qaeda and other Islamist fighters operating in Yemen could pose a threat to Saudi Arabia and to nearby shipping channels.

Interim president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, praised by the U.S. ambassador in Sanaa as being more effective against al Qaeda than his predecessor, was quoted as saying during a U.S. trip last month that he personally approved every attack.

While Washington usually avoids comment on the strikes in Yemen, the UK-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks U.S. operations, says as many as 56 civilians have been killed this year by drones.

			WADI DINAR, Libya (AP) — Pro-government militias battled fighters in a former stronghold of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, the fifth straight day of clashes that have killed at least 30 people.

The fighting in Bani Walid, some 140 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, has overlapped with the anniversary of Gadhafi's capture and killing on Oct. 20, 2011. A year since his death brought an end to Libya's civil war, Bani Walid is the most significant city in the country to still resist the nation's new authorities.

A resident said Sunday by telephone that pro-government militias and fighters in the city were clashing on its outskirts. The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said there were reports of new casualties, but that the fighting was less intense than a day earlier.

In Tripoli, some two hundred protesters demonstrated in front of the parliament building to urge the end of the fighting, which they say is harming only civilians. The demonstration was dispersed by a massive show of force when army units pulled up and opened fire above the heads of the crowd with heavy weaponry.

Government forces near Bani Walid said there were no civilians in the conflict area, and they had helped evacuate hundreds of residents a day earlier.

The official LANA news agency said at least 22 pro-government militiamen were killed during clashes Saturday. Pro-government militiamen said most of the casualties came during an ambush by fighters in the besieged city.

The violence Saturday coincided with conflicting reports about whether security forces had arrested Gadhafi's former spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, in Bani Walid.

The government said its forces had apprehended Ibrahim, but never produced evidence to support its statement. Then an audio recording purportedly by Ibrahim surfaced on the Internet denying that he had been arrested or that he was even in Libya.

The reports of Ibrahim's alleged arrested sparked brief celebrations in the Libyan capital. But in a reflection of the persistent lack of confidence in the new authorities, Libyans quickly began to demand that the government produce evidence — photographs or video — to back up their claims.

Government spokesmen could not be reached for further comment about Ibrahim.

Violence has flared periodically over the last year in Bani Walid. This round of fighting began when the pro-government Libya Shield militia besieged the town, blaming residents for the death of a well-known anti-Gadhafi rebel. Negotiations to hand over the suspects in the killing had failed.

Pro-government fighters on the road outside of Bani Walid were transporting fleeing civilians and foreign workers from the fighting. Some of the fleeing workers said others were locked up in the city because of the heavy shelling.

In the Wadi Dinar area, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside of Bani Walid, one pro-government fighter said civilians in the city are making it harder for his troops to go after fighters loyal to Gadhafi.

"We are doing two jobs. We are rescuing foreign workers, Egyptians and Africans, and putting them on vehicles out of the fighting area, and we are combing the area for armed gunmen," he said speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

Another fighter, Nidal, from Libya Shield, said the fighting over Bani Walid was focused on two fronts but that his opponents are well armed. He was speaking as clashes continued at the Wadi Dinar gate into the city, saying his force and the Bani Walid fighters were exchanging fire from two hilltops.

"This is going to take more than one day. There is a distance between us," he said.

In Tripoli, the situation in the late afternoon was tense around the parliament with dozens of protesters at the doors of the building itself while outside a few hundred more called for the end to the siege.

Militiamen acting as police arrived to contain the crowd but many were from the Souq al-Jumaa neighborhood, which earlier in the year lost several fighters in Bani Walid. The confrontation resulted in angry exchanges.

The men fired in the air several times to disperse the crowd, who responded with defiance, waving Libyan revolutionary flags and bearing their chests in front of the militiamen. Women made up around half of the crowd.

"In Bani Walid no one supports Gadhafi," said a veiled woman who identified herself only as Um Mohammed, or mother of Mohammed. "We support this government."

			Taiwan hospital blaze leaves many dead

Tuesday's blaze started in the early hours at Sinying Hospital's nursing facility housing mainly bed-bound senior patients in the southern city of Tainan, health officials said.

Tsai Ming-shih, who works for Sinying Hospital, said the 12 patients, who were housed on the second floor, died of smoke inhalation.

A fire official told reporters that the blaze possibly started in a storage room of the five-floor building, part of the Sinying Hospital.

More than 100 patients were evacuated during the incident, a local health official said.

An earlier estimate by an official had placed the number of injured at 72, but this was revised down in a health department statement.

TVBS cable news channel reported that relatives of the patients rushed to the hospital seeking their whereabouts as health minister Chiu Wen-ta assured the public that the authorities would identify the patients as soon as possible.

Television footage showed bed and wheelchair-bound patients being carried out from the burnt-out second floor to the hospital's lawn.

It was the worst hospital fire in recent years and the cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said.

Sean Chen, the Taiwanese prime minister, expressed his shock at the incident and sent his condolences to the families of the victims, his office said in a statement.

			Taiwan hospital fire kills 12 elderly residents

An early morning fire at a hospital in southern Taiwan has killed 12 patients and injured at least 60 more.

The fire swept through a nursing home inside the hospital in Tainan City that housed elderly and mostly bed-ridden patients.

A hospital official said the victims died of smoke inhalation. Injured residents were being treated at several different hospitals.

Police say they have arrested a man on suspicion of starting the fire.

Local reports say the man is a patient at the nursing home.

Remote location
The nursing home housed more than 100 people, many of whom were on respirators and unable to move on their own.

"It was pitch black and the heavy smoke was unbearable, it's really horrifying," a person who escaped the fire told Taiwan's Central News Agency.

One 94-year-old woman had to use her wheelchair to escape the blaze, hiding on the second floor until rescuers found her, local media reported.

Thirty fire engines were sent to the blaze, which was extinguished by 04:16 local time (20:16 GMT), just over 45 minutes after it was reported, officials said.

Tainan Mayor Lai Ching-te said the hospital's remote location and the fact that most of the patients were unable to move on their own made the situation worse.

Firefighters arrived at the scene 10 minutes after the fire broke out, but because of the large number of patients nearby residents had to pitch in to help transport some of them to other hospitals, says the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei.

The fire is believed to be one of deadliest at a Taiwanese hospital and one of the most serious on the island in recent years, says our correspondent.

Premier Sean Chen said in a statement that he had sent condolences to the victims' families.

			Massacre at Syrian Bakery Dims Hopes for a Holiday Truce

Syrian artillery gunners shelled a bread bakery full of workers and customers on Tuesday in an insurgent-held neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria's largest city, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 30 in what activists and videographers described as a sudden and devastating attack.

The shelling at Al Zura Bakery was among the more graphic episodes of violence to hit Aleppo and the capital, Damascus, on Tuesday, casting further doubts on the already dim prospects of a nationwide cease-fire for the coming Id al-Adha holiday, which the newly appointed peace envoy from the United Nations and Arab League, Lakhdar Brahimi, has been trying to negotiate for the past week.

Disturbing video uploaded to the Internet, which appeared genuine but could not be corroborated independently, showed what was described as the aftermath of the bakery shelling in Aleppo's Hanano district, with mangled bodies interspersed with upended loaves of freshly baked pita on the bakery's bloodied floor, as screaming rescue workers hauled the dead and wounded to waiting pickup trucks and taxicabs. Some of the victims were children, including a girl who was decapitated.

Abu al-Hasan, an activist from the Aleppo suburb of Maree, said in a Skype interview that most of the dead were bakery workers. He said it was unclear whether the attackers had been aiming for the bakery, located in a large warehouse. "The problem is those kinds of missiles are not guided to their intended targets," he said. "They're not precise. They fall on random buildings."

He said the shelling came as residents of the neighborhood, who had been too afraid to venture outside for the past few days, finally took the risk in order to buy food for Id al-Adha, a widely celebrated Muslim holiday that starts on Friday.

Aleppo, near Syria's northern border with Turkey, has been under siege for three months and has become a focal point of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad. Rebels have frustrated attempts by Syrian forces to retake the entire city and have threatened to cut off the military's supply lines there.

At the same time, bakeries in rebel-held areas of Aleppo have emerged as vitally important resources that are clearly potential targets for Syrian forces seeking to starve insurgents and their sympathizers into submission. Many of the bakeries are run by the insurgents, who have learned how to bake bread as part of the war effort.

The bakery attack came as Mr. Brahimi, a veteran Algerian statesman who became the special Syria peace envoy last month, left Syria after having met with President Assad and his subordinates over the weekend. A statement issued by the United Nations said Mr. Brahimi had held "frank and substantive" discussions with Mr. Assad, who had "given a positive reaction to his call for the government to declare a military pause during the Id al-Adha holiday."

But there was no official announcement of such a truce. Many Syrian activists and opposition figures had said it was highly unlikely anyway, given what they called Mr. Assad's complete lack of credibility and the inability of Mr. Brahimi's predecessor, Kofi Annan, to broker a pause in the fighting.

Mr. Brahimi had said he hoped that a religiously inspired truce would be the basis for at least the start of a dialogue between antagonists in the 19-month-old conflict, which has left more than 20,000 people dead. He is to brief the Security Council by video link from Cairo on Wednesday, said Martin Nesirky, a United Nations spokesman.

In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency reported Tuesday that the number of Syrians who have fled to neighboring countries to escape the conflict had climbed to more than 358,000 and that Lebanon had become the third country, following Turkey and Jordan, to house more than 100,000 Syrian refugees.

Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency, said in a statement that the sectarian mayhem in Lebanon caused by a bombing in Beirut on Friday had temporarily disrupted the agency's registration work in Lebanon. She also said most of the Syrians who had entered Lebanon to escape the war are from Homs, Syria's third-largest city.

			Deadly Taliban ambush in western Afghanistan

At least 10 members of the Afghan National Security Forces, ANSF, have died in a gun battle with the Taliban in western Afghanistan, local officials report.

A district police chief was among the five soldiers and five policemen killed in a late Monday raid on a convoy of security forces in Herat province.

"The enemies of our country ambushed our police convoy by using the dark night which resulted in the martyrdom of five Afghan police including Bismullah Khan - chief of Aubi district", said Bismullah Khan, provincial police spokesman.

A spokesman for Muhiudin Noori, provincial governor, said a group of Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army were searching on Monday for a group of fighters who had earlier set up a roadblock, stopping and seizing passing vehicles, when they were ambushed.

The Herat ambush was the bloodiest single incident for ANSF in western Afghanistan so far this year.

In recent months, fighters have been switching tactics and increasingly targeting Afghan security forces as the international coalition continues its drawdown toward a planned withdrawal of the majority of combat troops in 2014.

In the announcement of its so-called "spring offensive", the Taliban had cited ANSF as among their chief targets.

There were no reported casualties among the fighters, but police later arrested 25 suspects found in the area, Noori said.

Earlier on Tuesday, Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, condemned a NATO raid on Sunday that killed four children in eastern Logar province.

"Despite repeated pledges by NATO to avoid civilian casualties, innocent lives including of children are still being lost in fighting a terrorism whose havens and sanctuaries remain safe outside Afghanistan's borders", a statement issued by the presidential palace in Kabul read.

Coalition troops carried out the operation in Baraki Barak district in an effort to apprehend two armed fighters. But this resulted in the deaths of the four children who were tending to their animals in the same area, the statement said.

General John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan, ISAF,  offered his condolences to the victims'  families in a statement issued by the coalition and said he would meet them personally to offer "condolence payments".

Din Mohammad Darwesh, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the victims were between 10 and 13 years old.

On Sunday, NATO said it had conducted a precision airstrike in Baraki Barak district which killed three fighters."No other individuals were reported nearby at the time of the strike," a coalition statement said.

			Car bombs, mortars kill nine in Baghdad Shi'ite districts

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Bomb blasts and mortars killed at least nine people and wounded 28 more in Shi'ite districts in Baghdad on Tuesday, just days before Iraqis started celebrating the Islamic Eid al-Adha religious festival.

Car bombs exploded and mortars landed around the Shi'ite neighborhood of Shula, northwestern Baghdad, killing 8 people and wounded 28, and another person was killed by a mortar round in Kadhimiya area, police and hospital sources said.

"Three car bombs exploded one after the other, and we started to hear the screaming and shouting," said a policeman who was patrolling in Shula. "Some walls of houses collapsed, and glass was shattered everywhere."

Violence in Iraq is well below the bloody peak of sectarian war in 2006-2007, but al Qaeda affiliates and other Sunni Islamist insurgents often target Shi'ites in an attempt to stoke tensions between Sunni and Shi'ite communities.

The insurgents have launched one major assault a month since U.S. troops withdrew in December. Security officials say they believe insurgents may try to carry out a large attack during the religious holiday starting on Friday.

The monthly death toll from militant attacks across Iraq doubled in September to 365, the highest figure for more than two years, with most of them killed in bomb attacks, according to government figures released this month.

			African 'migrants' drown as boat sails to Spain

At least 14 people have drowned after a boat believed to be carrying African migrants started sinking off the coast of Morocco, Spanish officials said.

The Spanish coast guard said another 17 people had been rescued off the coast of Alhucemas.

One survivor said the boat had been carrying more than 70 migrants and a search is continuing, officials said.

Those on the boat are believed to be from sub-Saharan Africa.

A Spanish coast guard plane spotted the boat about 18 miles (29km) off the Moroccan coast on Thursday afternoon following a tip-off nearly 24 hours earlier that it had left Nador, Morocco, and was heading to Spain.

The Spanish newspaper El Pais said the alarm had been raised by a family member of a passenger on the boat.

The aircraft dropped an inflatable raft and some survivors managed to scramble on to it, the paper reported.

The survivors - 14 men and three women - were taken to the Moroccan port of Alhucemas. Some were said to be in need of urgent medical attention.

The BBC's Tom Burridge in Madrid says hundreds attempt the treacherous crossing from Morroco to Spain every year, often in basic boats, but many don't survive the journey.

In recent years Spain has seen a decline in the numbers of African migrants reaching its shores by boat, since a peak of 13,425 in 2008.

The migrants, fleeing poverty in West Africa, risk their lives in open, rickety boats threatened by strong currents.

			Dozens dead in Afghanistan Eid suicide blast

The Afghan president called the perpetrators of the attack 'the enemies of Islam and humanity' [Reuters]
A suicide attacker has killed at least 41 people and injured 51 in northern Afghanistan, local officials have said.

The attack on Friday occurred when a man detonated explosives that he was carrying outside a mosque in Maymana, the capital of Faryab province.

Witnesses say the attacker was wearing a police uniform as he passed through four security checkpoints.

He blew himself up at the entrance to the city's packed Eid Gah mosque, deputy provincial governor Abdul Satar Barez told the AFP news agency.

"Our latest death toll shows 41 deaths, and that might rise," he said.

"Nineteen were members of the security forces, including police, army and intelligence agents. Seventeen were civilians and five children are also among the dead."

Faryab, in Afghanistan's northwest, had been mostly peaceful until last week, whenan Afghan special forces operation killed the Taliban’s shadow provincial governor. Over 20 fighters were also killed in the attack.

Sediq Sediqqi, Afghan ministry of interior spokesman, called that operation "very successful" and cited it as a possible basis for Friday's attack.

Military targeted

Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said the 41 victims were a mixture of civilians and members of the Afghan National Security Forces.

The bulk of those killed were outside the mosque at the time of the attack.

"It appears the target was military and security force members", he said.

The provincial police chief sustained some injury.

Barez, like many other provincial officials, was at the scene at the time of the bombing and described the horror of the blast in the midst of a religious celebration.

"We had just finished Eid al-Adha prayers and we were congratulating and hugging each other," he said.

"Suddenly a big explosion took place and the area was full of dust and smoke and body parts of police and civilians were all over the place. It was a very powerful explosion."

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

One witness, Sayed Moqeed, described the bomber as appearing to be in his early teens.

"Suddenly I heard a very big explosion," he said. "Everywhere were pieces of bodies, hands and limbs. The suicide attacker was in police uniform, he looked to be around 14 or 15 years old."

Candace Rondeaux, a senior Afghanistan analyst with the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, said there were other actors participating in the conflict apart from the Taliban.

"There's so much focus on the Taliban and, of course, the pro-Islamist insurgency. What has to be remembered is that it is a deeply fragmented security environment where you have rival factions operating on a district-by-district [and] province-by-province basis," Rondeaux told Al Jazeera.

Surge in violence

Recently tribal elders seen as supporting the government have been killed by the Taliban in Faryab.

Rondeaux said in the north there had been an increase in violence in the past six months and targeted assassinations, particularly in the neighbourhood of Faryab, citing the killing three months ago of a member of parliament.

"We are likely to see a lot more skirmishes as the transition [that will follow the withdrawal of foreign troops] continues," Rondeaux said. 

The attack comes on the first of the three-day Eid holiday in Afghanistan.

Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, strongly condemned the attack, calling the perpetrators "the enemies of Islam and humanity".

"Those who take the happiness of Muslims during Eid days cannot be called human and Muslim," he said.

The US embassy in Kabul also "strongly" condemned the attack saying: "This attack against innocent worshippers further demonstrates the insurgency’s lack of respect for religion, faith and its disregard for the safety and security of the Afghan people ... Our sympathies go out to those affected by today’s bombing, and we wish a speedy recovery to the wounded".

Northern Afghanistan is relatively peaceful, with the Taliban, toppled from power in a US-led invasion in 2001, concentrating their operations in the south and east of the country.

The UN says 1,145 civilians were killed in the war in the first six months of this year, blaming 80 per cent of the deaths on anti-government fighters. Last year as a whole, a record 3,021 civilians died in the war, according to UN figures.
