text blah blah blah (you get it)
(star counts matter: 5 = details, 3 = notes, 80 = end of article
also, pay attention to the formats, death count should be a number followed
by the word 'dead', semicolons should separate aspects of the details, notes
are just there for my reference if there's anything in particular you think
I ought to notice or deal with for the article)
